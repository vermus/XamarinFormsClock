I made this clock App in Xamarin.Forms.
I used Xamarin.Forms.Shapes for drawing the clock background and the needles.
The needles rotate every 1 second, are anchored in the center point.
The clock is placed in the center of the screen and is responsive.
Couldn´t test it on iOS, because I don´t have a mac with me at this moment.
Tested on Android and UWP.

It took me something about 6 hours, with some interruptions.
